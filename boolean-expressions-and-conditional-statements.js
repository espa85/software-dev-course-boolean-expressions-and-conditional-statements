/*

Objective:
You will practice creating and combining boolean expressions
to drive logic and outcomes in you program.

Instructions:
If you are not familiar with the concept of a text-based adventure game,
let's set the scene...
Example: "You wake up in a dark forest. There are two paths ahead of you:
one leading to the mountains and one to a village.
Your choices will determine your fate!"

Define the Requirements: You must:
  - Write conditional statements to handle player choices.
  - Use boolean expressions to combine multiple conditions.
  - Include at least one use of logical operators (&&, ||, !).

Starter Code:
  - Run the following command in your terminal to install the readline-sync module:
    npm install readline-sync

Paste the following code into your editor:

*/

const readline = require('readline-sync');

// Ask for the player's character name
const name = readline.question("Welcome, traveler. What is your name? ");
console.log(`Greetings, ${name}! Your adventure begins now.`);

// Inventory setup (you can change these values to test different outcomes)
const hasTorch = true;
const hasMap = false;
const hasCompass = true;
const hasFoodAndWater = true;
const hasMoney = false;

// Weapon selection including "No Weapon"
const weaponChoices = ["sword", "sword and shield", "spear", "bow and arrow", "No Weapon"];
let weaponType = null;
let hasWeapon = false;

console.log("\nChoose your weapon by entering the corresponding number:");
weaponChoices.forEach((weapon, index) => {
  console.log(`${index + 1}. ${weapon}`);
});

let selectedIndex;
while (true) {
  selectedIndex = readline.questionInt("\nEnter your choice (1-5): ");

/* 

Add Customization and expand the game:
  - Add more choices and scenarios.
  - Include additional items (e.g., a sword, a compass).
  - Use nested conditionals and logical operators to create complex outcomes.
